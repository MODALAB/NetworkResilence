# Network Resilence
Codes, Algorithms, and packages for enhancing Cyber Physical networks resilience. 
For the warm up, you might use [Network-Generation.py](NetworkResilence/Network-Generation.py) file to generate the following bidirected graphs with m nodes:
- Scale Free 
- Random
- Complete
- Crossing Paths
- Matching Pairs
- Ring
- Central Ring
- Hub and Spoke 
- Single Depot 
- Diverging Tail
- Converging Tail
- Grid
- Complete Grid
- Tree
- Diamond
- Double U
Each network topology includes a certain number of nodes, links. Further you can use [Network-Measures.py](NetworkResilence/Network-Measures.py) to calculate thenumbr of cycles, Betta index, Gamma index, and average shortest path
